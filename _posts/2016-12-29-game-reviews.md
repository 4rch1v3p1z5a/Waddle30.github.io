Donkey kong

Controls = arrow keys, space

Making the game = a bit hard

Overall rating = 7/10

It's fun, challenging and hard. That’s what I like about nintendo, who made the game. I could make this in scratch.

Space invaders

controls =arrow keys, space

Making the game = pretty easy

Overall rating 4/10

An easy game to make and easy to play. If i were to make it in scratch i'd have a shop in it where you can buy power ups.

Pacman

Controls= arrow keys

Making the game = quite hard

Overall rating = 6/10

The way you can just teleport to the other side is amazing. Also the ghosts speed up! So complete it fast.

Frogger

controls= arrow keys

Making the game = easy

Overall rating= 2/10

This game is the world's easiest game to make. It is also pretty boring because you only got to move five frogs to goals.

Mario

controls= z,x,,arrow keys

Making the game= normal

overall rating= 7/10

Great platformer, but you couldn't save your game whereas now you can. Nintendo made mario and donkey kong and they are great games.

Chucky egg

controls= space, arrow keys

Making the game =pretty hard

Overall rating = 7/10

Quite addictive.

Mario bros 3

Controls = z,x, arrow keys

Making the game =quite hard because of a gliding power-up

Overall rating= 8/10

After 3 years (funny, the title has the number 3 in it.), a new mario came out in 1988.

You could now go back, choose levels, and battle other characters which aren't enemies in disguise as bowser which was much better and more interesting. Also it had a new design for mario and more enemies for mario to battle. I would love to play this game any time! There also was mario bros 2, which came out 14 days before it so i’m guessing mario bros 2 wasn’t a great hit.

Arkanoids

Controls = arrow keys left and right

Making the game = not that easy 

Overall rating = 3/10

I don't think this is a great game. It’s quite boring playing and moving around the ship. I wouldn’t suggest this game to people.

Kirby's dreamland

Controls = z, x, arrow keys

Making the game = hard

Overall rating = 6/10

Kirby is another game made by nintendo. It has got different characters and different powers. It is quite fun, but you can't choose levels, which is quite bad but also there are a lot of bosses.

tetris

Controls = arrow keys

Making the game = hard

Overall rating = 6/10.

It is a quite addictive game but it needs more shapes
