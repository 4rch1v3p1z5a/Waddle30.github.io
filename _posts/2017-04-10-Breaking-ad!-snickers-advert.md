On the 29 of march, I broke down a fantasy advert. The advert was none other than the Snickers peanut butter squared advert. Here is the link:

What was actually real was someone eating a snickers peanut butter squared and someone doing a survey to "Sharks". I really wish those were real sharks, but sharks don't speak our language, they speak Shark. The unrealistic part was sharks out of water, speaking our language and tasting a chocolate sweet that steve ate- which was probably destroyed in steve’s stomach acid- by eating steve. If sharks were speaking they would probably say “hey, hey mate, can step into my mouth and check if I have a wobbly tooth?” I decided to search up one question, which was: do sharks eat snickers peanut butter squared, and it only came up with the shark snickers peanut butter squared advert.

I hope you liked this blog post, and read some of my other blog posts.
